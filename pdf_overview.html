<h2>Introduction</h2>
 The JLaby is the Java version of an old OS/390 PL/I multiplayer game. That game was 
 a fun project, born out of boredom when I still worked for a large company. Sometimes 
 I didn't have any work to do at all, so I started creating games. One day, me and 
 some friends of mine decided to start a persistent multiplayer game, written in PL/I, 
 using a DB/2 database for persistency, and providing a "3D" view (though the graphics 
 had to be "drawn" with text characters - see screenshots).
<p>
Years later - I had started an own company together with some friends - I decided that 
the request-oriented, stateless character of that old OS/390 game was actually a good 
fit for the web. So I collected the old sourcecode, reusing only the text "graphics", 
but rewriting everything else from scratch in a more modern manner (using Java servlets with JDBC).
<p>
Now that it works, there's only one catch: There is still no actual game in the whole 
thing. You can walk around in the 3D world and do lots of stuff, but... that's it. 
Anyway, maybe sometime some real game will arise from it. As for now, it's just fun doing it.

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<ol><li><b>What is the JLaby?</b><br> 
The JLaby is a hobby project with no purpose other than having fun doing it.
It implements a simple, rectangle-based 3D online world. It provides a
persistent world and user state through a database. The cheat-avoiding design
leaves all decisions to the server, the client never gets any information it
doesn't need. For instance, the client never knows, which direction it is
looking at in the game world. The server just tells the client what it sees.
It's like in the real world. As long as you don't have a compass, you have no
bloody idea about the direction your looking at (north, south..). 
<p>
The request-oriented design makes the implementation of an action game almost
impossible, since the display of a client does not update until the user
refreshes it. Therefore, other types of games should be created with JLaby [fill
in fresh and original idea here].
<p>
On the other hand, the design should scale very well and allows for any HTTP
client to roam the JLaby world. That's why you can get into the JLaby with
your webbrowser. And a MIDP client exists as well.<br>
</li>

  <li><b>What features are planned for the JLaby world?</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Handling of items, including use and combination (keys to lock and
    unlock doors, maps, teleporters, maybe weapons, spray to print stuff on the
    walls etc.), exchange with other users, stealing etc.</li>

    <li>Bots (computer-controlled characters) that will interact with the
    players, maybe also with each other. Expect the first implementations to be
    very silly!</li>
    <li>Allow some involvement of the users, for instance by providing means to
    upload a customized, unique text graphics file for the own character.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Who the heck want's text-character graphics nowadays?</b><br>
  In this world of ultra-realistic sophisticated realtime 3D virtual realities,
  it may look a little bit outdated (only a little), but its simplicity is
  exactly the point. Well, ok, I just needed an excuse for my nostalgic feelings.
  Nevertheless, I really find it pretty cool myself! :-))<br></li>

  <li><b>Why do it if there is no game??</b><br>
  It's still better writing useless software than driving around and polluting
  the world, or killing innocent animals on a hunt! And, for the game question,
  maybe someone will have an idea about that sometime. But before you have, read
  the next point, please.<br></li>

  <li><b>Why not just create a fantasy / scifi RPG?</b><br>
  *Yaawwwnn*... Oh, really, c'mon... there is at least a dozen of such games on
  SourceForge alone. And it's a fact that of all people on earth, only a
  minority really digs stuff like that. The overwhelming success of games like &quot;The
  Sims&quot; (which is the first major blockbuster game known to have been bought by
  at least as many women as men) is proof enough. So, personally, I'd prefer
  something fresh, constructive (killing preferably not included), and most of
  all, humorous. Well, ok, I'm flexible about the killing part, as long as it
  fit's in in a more black humour (Monty Python?) style.<br></li>

  <li><b>What clients / platforms are supported?</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML (webbrowser)</li>
    <li>MIDP (working skeleton code exists)</li>
    <li>*J2SE* does not exist yet - do you wanna do it?</li>
  </ul></li>
  
  <li><b>Is it free?</b><br>
  It is indeed, as much as you can think, as it's released under 
  the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU Public License (GPL)</a></li>
